# projectTwo
Node mongoose and express, an app to help clear your mind.

This app will allow users to sign in. 

It will keep track of diferent methods the users uses to clear their mind after a day of school, or studying. 

It will allow the user to add personal notes to each method, and give it a rating. It will also allow the user to 
adjust or edit the method. Full CRUD. 

My main focus is on the CSS. If you have had a long day, you wont want any issues finiing a bit of information
on how to help clear your mind. 

This app will utilize specific color schemes, and have a extremely simple user interface. 
ALso there will be a button to toggle darkmode. :)

This app will utilize what we have been taught in mongodb, moongoose, node, express, javascript, html, css, and other skills that
are essential to programming.
