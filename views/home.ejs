            <p>What Causes Brain Fog? </p>
            <p>Brain fog can be a symptom of a nutrient deficiency,
                sleep disorder, bacterial overgrowth from overconsumption
                of sugar, depression, or even a thyroid condition.
                Other common brain fog causes include eating too much and
                too often, inactivity, not getting enough sleep, chronic stress,
                and a poor diet. These are some of the most common causes of
                brain fog that we see at Parsley Health.
